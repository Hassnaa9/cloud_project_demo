Project Highlights:

Designed and deployed a Hub-and-Spoke VNet architecture with full VNet peering and traffic forwarding

Secured the network using Network Security Groups (NSGs) to manage traffic at subnet level (HTTP, HTTPS, and ICMP)

Used Azure Bastion for safe, browser-based RDP/SSH connections without exposing public IPs

Deployed a web application using Local Git deployment directly to Azure App Service

Enabled diagnostics and logging with Azure Monitor

Conducted cost analysis and identified optimization strategies for TCO

Skills Gained:

Secure VM access through Azure Bastion

Deploying and managing web apps using Local Git

Subnetting, peering, and routing in Azure VNets

Real-world teamwork and cloud documentation practices

This experience sharpened my expertise in cloud networking, app deployment, and Azure infrastructure ,and Iâ€™m eager to bring that value to a professional setting.
